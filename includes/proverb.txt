The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

It's no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.

Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone.

Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.
