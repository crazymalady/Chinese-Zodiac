Hi ma'am Tracy, Goodevening. 

I am dreadfully sorry about my late submission of activities. I was trying to find time just to be able to do it immediately but I have a very tight schedule, aside from school activities I am also active in attending and participating in our church online (5 meetings a week) and also working on our personal projects (website) that me and my friends decided to work on remotely. 
It's not that I am not prioritising this study, but sure you'll understand it if it was part 
of your field it's like I want to focus on that to gain an edge in my career in the future. 
This wasn't a good excuse, I can say so but I just want to be honest rather than not. 
Berlitz was also part of my life and as much as possible I am doing my very best to submit it on time,
it just happens to be that I really can't due to some reasons. And to be honest I'm having pressure to a lot of these things 
despite that it only looked like it was easy being a student. Not swearing, but I'll top up or make it up to you by trying to
submitting activities on a timely manner. Hope to see you again on berlitz class. Thanks a lot!   

Yours Trully,
/Jennifer
