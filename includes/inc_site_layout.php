A web template is a tool used to separate content from presentation in web design, and for mass-production of web documents. It is a basic component of a web template system.

Web Template can be used to set up any type of Web site. In its simplest sense, a Web template operates similarly to a form letter for use in setting up a Website.
Content (from a database), and "presentation specifications" (in a Web template), are combined (through the template engine) to mass-produce Web documents.

<b>Template Uses</b>
<br/><br/>
Web developers can use templates from any individual or organization to set up a website. Once they purchase or download a template, they replace all generic information in the web template with their personal, organizational, or product information. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Templates are commonly used to:</b>
<br/><br/>

<!--
<ul>
<li>Display personal information or daily activities as in a blog</li>
<li>Sell products online</li>
<li>Display information about a company or organization</li>
<li>Display family history</li>
<li>Display a gallery of photos</li>
<li>Place music files such as MP3 files on-line for play through a web browser</li>
<li>Place videos online for public viewing</li>
<li>Set up a private login area online</li>
</ul>-->

Effective Separation
A common goal among experienced web developers is to develop and deploy applications that are flexible and easily maintainable. An important consideration in reaching this goal is the separation of business logic from presentation logic.

One major rationale behind "effective separation" is the need for maximum flexibility in the code and resources dedicated to the presentation logic.[4] Client demands, changing customer preferences and desire to present a "fresh face" for pre-existing content often result in the need to dramatically modify the public appearance of web content without disrupting the underlying infrastructure as little as possible.

The distinction between "presentation" (front end) and "business logic" (infrastructure) is important, because:

Presentation source code language can differ from other code assets.
Developers often make application components at separate times and locations.
Workers skill sets don't always include both presentation skills and business logic coding ability.
Code assets are easier to read and maintain when the system keeps various component types separate and loosely coupled

Reusability
Not all potential web template users can hire developers to design a system. Additionally, some may wish to use the Web but have little technical proficiency. Thus, a number of developers and vendors have released web templates specifically for non-technical people to use. Web template reusability is also important for even highly skilled and technically experienced developersâ€”but it is especially critical to those who rely on simplicity and "ready-made" web solutions.

Such "ready-made" web templates are sometimes free, and easily made by an individual domestically. However, specialized web templates are sometimes sold online. Although there are numerous commercial sites that offer web templates for a licensing fee, there are also free and "open-source" sources as well.
