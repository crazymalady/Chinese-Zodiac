O' Lord Thank You for Everything! For certainties and Uncertainties, I shall say Thank You. If I am not weak I may not lean on to you, make me thirst in your words that I will seek them each and everyday. Make me realize that without hearing your words, I will suffer in hunger and thirst. Make me see your real worth in my life and weigh what's important than not; and the beauty of appreciating you each and every day.

VERSE OF THE DAY:
Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of Life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst".

- John 6:35
